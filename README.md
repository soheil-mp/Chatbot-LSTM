# Conversational Based Agent

This is an end-to-end conversational based agent which consists of three components: 
1. __Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):__ Agent takes speech as input. There is a button which after pushing it you can begin talking with the agent.
2. __Text-to-Text Chatbot:__ After converting the input voice to text. The agent will find a proper response based on the given text.
3. __Text-to-Speech (TTS):__ Ultimately the agent will turn the answer in a speech form.

This project is developed so you can have an AI companion in which you can talk about anything in your life.
